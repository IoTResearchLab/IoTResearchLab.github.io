<p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Vehicle and pedestrian traffic scene is a vital problem since it is expected to elevate the efficiency of the traffic lights or crosswalks and reduce traffic congestion and traffic accidents. </p>
<br/>
<p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>Traffic accidents have become a severe issue in many cities. Millions of people die in traffic accidents annually around the world.  The persistently high rate of pedestrian and cyclist deaths in Canada is a major public health concern.  Jaywalking is a major factor causing pedestrian accidents in traffic.</p>
<br/>
<p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>As a core component of intelligent transportation, real-time and effective vehicle and pedestrian counting are of great significance for transportation management.  It helps to determine the volume and direction of traffic as well as tell how people use different locations at specific times and locations.  Moreover, it can assist traffic planners to establish safer pedestrian and traffic management solutions to better inform decision-making and plan for the future, such as adding an additional crosswalk or better timing a traffic signal to improve pedestrian safety. In order to analyze the cause of jaywalking, it is crucial to monitor jaywalking behaviours and utilize vehicle and pedestrian traffic data.  </p>

        <h1>Proposed System</h1>
</div>

  <img src="/img/project10/p1.png"/>
 
  <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>The proposed system could detect and track vehicles, pedestrians, and jaywalkers by using deep learning techniques for real-time detection.</p>
  <br/>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>The surveillance camera will be installed at the specific location which will stream the real-time traffic data. A deep learning model will be built to detect vehicles and pedestrians. The system not only allows users to create lanes and crosswalks to count vehicles and pedestrians but also creates jaywalking boundaries to detect jaywalkers in specific areas. Deepsort algorithm will be utilized to identify and track the vehicles and pedestrians as well as their direction. The system allows the users to add multi-camera streams and features for specific cameras such as vehicle counting, pedestrian counting or jaywalking.</p>
    <br/>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '1.2rem' }}>The system illustrates various easy-to-understand dashboard visualizations to represent the multiple captured vehicles, pedestrians, and jaywalkers in real-time. Furthermore, the warning system is utilized for detecting jaywalkers which could trigger an SMS and/or email to designated persons in cases where jaywalking is detected. These insights can help users to decide whether additional crosswalks are needed and where to improve pedestrian safety.</p>
